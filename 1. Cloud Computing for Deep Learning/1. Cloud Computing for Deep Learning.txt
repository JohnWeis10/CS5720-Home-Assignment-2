Question 1: Cloud Computing for Deep Learning (20 points)
Cloud computing offers significant advantages for deep learning applications.
(a) Define elasticity and scalability in the context of cloud computing for deep learning. (10 points)
(b) Compare AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio in terms of their deep
 learning capabilities. (10 points)

a: Elasticity in cloud computing for deep learning is the extent for which a system is able to dynamically adjust its
resource allocation to different demands.

Scalability in cloud computing for deep learning is the systems capacity to handle increasing amounts of storage or 
use without compromising performance.

b: AWS SageMaker is a fully managed service that automates model tuning and training, and also supports Tensorflow
and PyTorch. 
Google Vertex AI is optimized for TPU usage and utilizes Managed Jupyter Notebooks for collaberation 
on projects. Google Vertex AI also provides automated model training. 
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio also supports Tensorflow and PyTorch like SageMaster and also supports Scikit-learn.
