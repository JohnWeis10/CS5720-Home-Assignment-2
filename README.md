## Tasks and Descriptions

1. Cloud Computing for Deep Learning   
- Definitions for elasticity and scalability in the context of cloud computing for deep learning
- Comparison of major cloud platforms for deep learning. Compare AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.


2. Convolution Operations with Different Parameters   
- Perform convolution using a custom kernel on a 5×5 matrix.  
- Apply different combinations of stride and padding using TensorFlow.  
- Output and compare feature maps.

 3. CNN Feature Extraction with Filters and Pooling   
- Implement Edge Detection Using Convolution.
- Implement Max Pooling and Average Pooling.

 4. Implementing and Comparing CNN Architectures  
- Implement the AlexNet architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Define and use a residual block to build a simple ResNet-like model.  
- Print and analyze model summaries.
